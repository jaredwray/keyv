As always, this includes dependency updates which you can see below under *What's Changed*. Let's get started:\r\n\r\n## Typescript update to many of the storage adapters adding in `<Value=any>`\r\n\r\nThis was a fix for https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/issues/512 and we have tested it but happy for any feedback on it. \r\n\r\n## Compression Packages are now more robust! \r\n\r\nWe did our initial look at how to add compression into the system and with this latest release made it much more robust. Currently supporting `compress-brotli` and `compress-gzip` each one of the packages now have type definitions and the main `Keyv` has an interface to define what these should look like:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n\tinterface CompressionAdapter {\r\n\t\tasync compress(value: any, options?: any);\r\n\t\tasync decompress(value: any, options?: any);\r\n\t\tasync serialize(value: any);\r\n\t\tasync deserialize(value: any);\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use these compression libraries you can do the following:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst KeyvBrotli = require('@keyv/compress-brotli');\r\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\r\n\r\nconst keyv = new Keyv({store: new Map(), compression: new KeyvBrotli()});\r\n```\r\nNOTE: when you do use compression the functions `serialize` and `deserialize` are overwritten.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* redis - removing reliance on this package by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/499\r\n* offline - removing this package as no longer needed by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/500\r\n* fixed namespace clear issue by @alphmth in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/501\r\n* keyv - upgrading ava to 4.3.3 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/503\r\n* Compression Updates by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/502\r\n* Revert \"Compression Updates\" by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/505\r\n* keyv - upgrading eslint to 8.24.0 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/504\r\n* keyv - upgrading typescript and tsd to latest by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/506\r\n* keyv - upgrading xo to 0.52.3 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/507\r\n* memcache - upgrading typescript to 4.8.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/508\r\n* redis - upgrading typescript to 4.8.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/509\r\n* offline - upgrading typescript to 4.8.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/510\r\n* Compression updates v2 by @alphmth in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/511\r\n* sqlite - upgrading sqlite3 to 5.1.2 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/514\r\n* sqlite - upgrading typescript to 4.8.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/515\r\n* sqlite - upgrading xo to 0.52.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/517\r\n* postgres - upgrading typescript to 4.8.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/518\r\n* postgres - upgrading xo to 0.52.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/519\r\n* mysql - upgrading typescript to 0.52.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/520\r\n* mysql - upgrading xo to latest by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/521\r\n* Etcd - upgrading xo to 0.52.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/522\r\n* etcd - upgrading typescript to 4.8.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/524\r\n* tiered - upgrading typescript to 4.8.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/525\r\n* tiered - upgrading xo to 0.52.4 by @jaredwray in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/526\r\n* added fix for value by @alphmth in https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/pull/523\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/compare/2022-09-19...2022-10-17",

There are zero API breaking changes though, if you clear your store, Keyv will continue to work with no code changes required.\r\n\r\nMoving forward this breaking change will allow us to add opt in changes to data structures for performance improvements in certain use cases without breaking backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nIt also makes it much easier to implement data migration tools for automatically transfering data from one Keyv store to another.\r\n\r\nMore info on the data structure change here: https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv/pull/29"
