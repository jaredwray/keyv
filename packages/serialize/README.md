This is a serialization package for `Keyv` and is based on `node:buffer` serialization. It is used to serialize and deserialize data for storage in `Keyv` storage adapters. To use your own serialization you can do the following:

```javascript
import Keyv from 'keyv';
const keyv = new Keyv({ serialize: JSON.stringify, deserialize: JSON.parse });
```

Pass in your own serialization functions to the `Keyv` constructor. The `serialize` function should return a string and the `deserialize` function should return an object.

## Warning: Using custom serializers means you lose any guarantee of data consistency. You should do extensive testing with your serialisation functions and chosen storage engine.
