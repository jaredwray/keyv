Keyv is a simple key/value store with support for multiple backends via storage adapters. The Keyv API is basically just a promisified subset of the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) API. Keyv also has TTL support making it suitable as a cache or persistent storage.

## Install

```shell
npm install --save keyv
```
